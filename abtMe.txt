a passionate web developer with a penchant for crafting engaging
 and innovative online experiences. With 2 years of experience 
in the ever-evolving realm of web development, I thrive on turning 
ideas into reality through clean, efficient code and intuitive 
design.

I found my way into web development from doing art and printmaking,
 a change completely out of left field. But that background has been 
instrumental in my approach to web design + development. Over the past couple years, 
I've advanced my skills in a variety of programming languages and frameworks, 
including Javascript, PHP, MySQL, React, React Native, nodeJs, and Expo, allowing 
me to tackle projects with versatility and expertise. 

Beyond the technical aspects, I take pride in my ability to understand the users' needs 
and translate them into dynamic, user-centric websites and applications. Whether it's 
building responsive layouts or implementing cutting-edge features, 
I'm committed to delivering solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations.

When I'm not immersed in lines of code, you can find me exploring the latest trends 
in web development, working on my own pieces/ projects. or seeking inspiration from art, design, and nature. I'm a firm believer 
in lifelong learning and continuously strive to expand my skill set to stay ahead in this 
dynamic industry.
